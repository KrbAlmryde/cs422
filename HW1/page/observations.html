<h2><u>Use-Cases and Activities</u></h2>
<section>
    <h4>Shower Use-cases </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b><u>Washing ones body</u></b>
            <p>Obviously the most common use-case involved when using a device such as a shower is for the purposes of cleaning ones body. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <b><u>Relaxation</u></b>
            <p>At least for me, often times when Ive had a really stressful day, I will use the shower as a method of relaxation. The steam from the hot water has an almost cleansing effect, allowing me to take my mind off the stressful day. This is of course a terrible waste of water so I dont use this method often </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><u>Holistic care</u></b>
            <p>Related to relaxation, often when I feel ill, such as when I have a headache, I use the shower as a means of holistic care. For reasons I dont fully understand, Ive found it can often relive (at least temporarily) my ailments</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <b><u>Giving the dog a bath</u></b>
            <p>Contrary to the term above, when washing my dog, the bath is merely the receptacle in which to contain my dog. I use the shower to clean her. Living in an apartment and having no access to an outdoor hose, Ive found that this is an efficient method of maximizing the coverage of water-to-dog ratio when rinsing the soap and grim from her.</p>
        </li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Bath Use-cases </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b><u>Relaxation</u></b>
            <p>The primary use I have for taking a bath is for relaxation. There is nothing better after a particularly long day than a soak in the tub.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><u>Brewing Beer</u></b>
            <p>At least one occasion I may or may not have used the bathtub as a means of fermenting alcohol for the purposes of consumption</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><u>Entertainment</u></b>
            <p>'Bath time' as a child was more like playtime than it was a period to clean ones body. Add the collection of action-figures and a mountain of bubbles, and you had yourself hours of fun! Mom and Dad were frequently annoyed by this.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><u>Laundry</u></b>
            <p>As a starving graduate student and a Chicago apartment dweller to boot, Ive found myself on more than one occasion lacking the available funds to wash my clothes in a traditional receptacle. When considering what a washing machine actually consists of: a vat of water, detergent, and a mechanism to aggitate the clothing in the water to perfuse the detergent into the clothes, you realize the bathtub makes a suitable replacement in a pinch. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><u>Warmth</u></b>
            <p>Early on in my tenure at Chicago, I found myself suffering from the bitterly cold winter. To combat this, I would fill the tub with warm water and soak up the warmth. This activity was also performed in conjunction with actually cleaning and/or relaxing, but it was just as important on its own as any of the other use cases.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

<h2><u>Usability</u></h2>
<section>
Banking on cultural norms and expectations, at least those found in the united states, we can be confident that the Shower tells us it is some kind of device which projects water from its source simply by the position it is in. Further to that, the placement of the control knob suggests that it has something to do with the water output. It obviously lacks any textual information that says "Turn Shower/Bath on here!", but it does exhibit an object which can be griped and manipulated. If anything it exhibits and object designed to be griped and manipulated. This would likely encourage a new user to attempt to manipulate it, if only to see what happens.
