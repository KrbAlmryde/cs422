    <h3>What works?</h3>
    <p>
        Overall I am pretty impressed with the design of this particular shower and bath/spa. Adjusting the temperature is clear cut and leaves little to the imagination (in a good way!). The arrows clearly indicate which direction the user needs to turn the control knob, and their color provides implicit meaning as to which direction indicates hot or cold.

        The controls of the spa turned out to be surprisingly clear in terms of their usage. The central button is clearly not a dial and exhibits push-like aesthetics. The dials which are found on the ends of the button array both have visual reference guides suggesting a possible magnitude being manipulated depending on where the dial points.

    <h3>What needs improvement?</h3>
    <p>
        The shower head appears a bit complicated at first glance due to its bulkiness. The labels along its side, while helpful in identifying the types of shape the water can be sprayed, lack any clear label identifying which form the water will take when it leaves the shower head. Thus, every use of the shower is a surprise when it comes to the type of spray to be used. Furthermore, the decorative grooves on the side of the shower head which are used to adjust the spray type are not clear at first glance what their utility is. That is to say, it looks pretty, so Im not inclined to assume that it is a surface meant to be gripped. That said, it is not unreasonable to assume that with those symbols mapped to the shower head in the manner seen that a twisting motion might be required.

        What is not clear with regards to the spa control dials is what the dials actually map to. It would probably be fair to assume that they are associated with the jets in the tub, but as far as what knob controls...well anything, is entirely obfuscated. Users might assume the mapping relates to the jets in the front & back respectively, but it could also mean that the knob on the right controls the jets on the right side of the individual while those on the left control the left. The only true way to find out is through trial and error. Further more, because of this confusion it likely deters casual users of the system, as they arent entirely sure which jet is controlled by what.

    <h3>Mapping</h3>
    <p>
        As mentioned above, the mapping of the spa's jet controls are unclear. We know that they affect at least two sets of the jets in some capacity, but what in what way it is not entirely clear. It could be the left and right side, it could be the front and the back....to that end, what exactly do the dials actually do? I can speak to the fact that I have used them (several times!) and I know that they affect the intensity of the water jet stream. By inference that much is clear, but it could be a lot better. What it does right is in the magnitude. The dials have symbolic notations which highlight how much power you should expect to receive from the jets.

    <h3>Symbols & Language</h3>
    <p>
        Overall the system keeps the language to a minimum and relies mostly on symbols and letters to indicate what types of functions are available. From a minimalistic standpoint I think it does a decent job of this.

        Case in point, the control knob. The metal plate at the base of the control knob has engraved letters on the left and right hand side of the control knob indicating a <b>H</b> for <i>hot</i> and a <b>C</b> for <i>cold</i> respectively. That alone is pretty explicit in terms of which direction to turn the knob to get the temperature you want.
