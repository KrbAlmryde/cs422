        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Twisting dial-like control mechanism used to adjust the spray of water. There are <b>6</b> spray options
                <img src="./assets/showerhead2.jpg" alt="Main Page" width="50%"/></a>
            </li>
            <li>grooves along the side which make it easy to grip and turn</li>
            <li>Adjustable head which enables control over the direction of water flow</li>
<!--             <li>
                Rain setting consists of several nodes spraying long thin streams of water in an wide area. Good for covering the largest area with the highest volume of water. Pressure tends to be lower as there are many streams of water active.
                Massage setting consists of relatively small set of nodes spraying water in controlled high pressure bursts, somewhat akin to a machine gun. Good for massaging sore muscles, pretending you have a machine gun, and removing dirt.
            </li>
