                <b>Meteor:</b> A small body of matter from outer space that enters the earth's atmosphere, becoming
                incandescent as a result of friction and appearing as a streak of light.

                <b>Meteorite:</b> A meteor that survives its passage through the earth's atmosphere such that part of it
                strikes the ground. More than 90 percent of meteorites are of rock, while the remainder
                consist wholly or partly of iron and nickel.

        "Macrometeorites: the largest meteorites throughout history" is an interactive visualization developed by
        <a href="http://www.torre.nl/">Roxana Torre</a> to show the incidence of meteorites through time across the world. Through the interface it is
        possible to explore meteorites according to the year in which they were found, their material, and the
        location in which they were found. While there have been more than 45700 recorded meteorite landing,
        approximately 3800 have a mass larger than 1kg. The focus, then, of this visualization is on these
        "Macrometerorites".
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two categories of "Macrometerorite" identified in this visualization. Those classified as
        <b class="falls">Falls</b>,which have been observed while they transited the atmosphere or impacting the
        earth, and those called <b class="finds">Finds</b>, which had been discovered after they have impacted
        earth.
    </p>

        Meteorites can be further divided into three types: <strong>Stony</strong>meteorites which are rocks, iron meteorites and
        stony-iron meteorites which contain both metallic and rocky material. Very special cases are a few meteorites
        which happen to come from the Moon and Mars.
