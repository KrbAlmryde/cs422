<h2>Critical Discussion</h2>
<section>
    <p>
        Following our review of the good and the bad, a summary review is in order to discuss the overall effectiveness
        of this application and whether or not it succeeds in its aim to effectively visualize the rate of discovery of
        large (> 3kg) meteorites.
    </p>

    <h3>What works?</h3>
    <p>
        The application does a nice job of visualizing the number of occurrences and the frequency at which those discoveries
        occur. It also does a very nice job of providing as much information about the data being visualized as possible,
        enabling the user to really explore the data. I liked that fact that when I clicked on a particular point I was
        taken to a site that gave all kinds of information about "space rocks". More detail than, frankly, I ever wanted
        or needed to know, but that is alright because it doesnt shove it down my throat nor does it make it overly
        difficult to find.

    <h3>What needs improvement?</h3>
    <p>
        The color scheme, while nice and relatively simple for us normal visioned folk, is really lacking when it
        concerns those individuals with color vision deficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
        For that matter, it would have been useful if the developer had chosen a wider selection of colors to distinguish
        between the different types of meteorites so that at the least the user had visual confirmation of the diversity
        of meteorites.
    </p>
    <p>
        The visualization is really lacking in terms of graphs of any kind. While the time series graph is useful for
        displaying the discoveries of meteorites over the course of history, it does nothing to answer other question
        about the number of a certain type of meteorite

    <h3>What questions do people want to ask?</h3>
    <p>
        I regularly found myself asking how many meteorites of a specific type (Stony, Iron, etc) were discovered with
        no easy way to answer that question.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also found myself wanting to know what, if any, trends could be identified
        in terms of the rate of discovery. Judging from the map its clear that places with a higher population density
        had more reported findings of meteorites, but because there was no city, or state data tracked we cant really
        say which ones without some work.
    </p>
    <p>
        One obvious questions is to ask what the rate of discovery over time is. This question is answered pretty easily
        using the time series bar chart
