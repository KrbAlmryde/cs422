<h2>The Bad</h2>
<p>
    Perhaps the most obvious issue with the application is its total disregard for individuals suffering from color vision
    deficiency, more colloquially known as Color Blindness. Arguably you can make some distinctions between the different
    types based solely on color intensity and brightness, however this is inconsistent, especially considering the images
    are slightly opaque causing some colors to darken as multiple data points overlap

        Though the application distinguishes the major categories
        (<b class="falls">Falls</b> vs <b class="finds">Finds</b>) by color, Orange and yellow respectively, it does not
        make the distinction between the different types of meteoroids. In this case, <strong>Stony</strong>,
        <strong>Iron</strong>, and <strong>Combined-type</strong>. It is up to the user to specifically filter these
        characteristics using the builtin filter option.

        Interaction with the map must be done explicitly with the map directly. That is, the mouse must be hovering over
        some part of the map itself, otherwise nothing can be interacted with. For example, if the user wishes to zoom
        into a specific location, the mouse must be hovering over geographical landmass. If the mouse is hovering what
        could be considered a body of water, interaction is restricted. The same is true when trying to drag the map to
        reorient the view. Unless the user is dragging landmass, interaction is restricted.
