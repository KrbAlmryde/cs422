<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
    Upon loading the page for the first time, the user (<b>YOU</b>) will be
    presented with a display consisting of three 'walls'. In the center wall you
    will see two icons which look like the following:
</p>
<img src="" alt="Draw a bath, or start a shower?">
<section>
    <p>What individuals with typical color vsion would see</p>
    <img src="./assets/badColor0.png" alt="Normal"/>

    <p>The same page in as viewed by individuals who cannot see the color Green</p>
    <img src="./assets/badColor1.png" alt="Deuteranomaly"/>


    <div class="images">
        <p>The same page in as viewed by individuals who cannot see the color Red </p>
        <img src="./assets/badColor.png" alt="Protanopia"/>
        <p>The same page in as viewed by individuals who cannot see the color Blue</p>
        <img src="./assets/badColor2.png" alt="Tritanopia"/>
    </div>
</section>

        Though the application distinguishes the major categories
        (<b class="falls">Falls</b> vs <b class="finds">Finds</b>) by color, Orange and yellow respectively, it does not
        make the distinction between the different types of meteoroids. In this case, <strong>Stony</strong>,
        <strong>Iron</strong>, and <strong>Combined-type</strong>. It is up to the user to specifically filter these
        characteristics using the builtin filter option.

        Interaction with the map must be done explicitly with the map directly. That is, the mouse must be hovering over
        some part of the map itself, otherwise nothing can be interacted with. For example, if the user wishes to zoom
        into a specific location, the mouse must be hovering over geographical landmass. If the mouse is hovering what
        could be considered a body of water, interaction is restricted. The same is true when trying to drag the map to
        reorient the view. Unless the user is dragging landmass, interaction is restricted.
