<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h4>Mode selection</h4>
<p>
    Upon loading the page for the first time, the user (<b>YOU</b>) will be
    presented with a display consisting of three 'walls'. In the center wall you
    will see two icons which look like the following:
    <img src="html/images/instruct0.png" width="50%" alt="Draw a bath, or start a shower?">
    <p>
        The icons in question depict a <b>Bathtub</b> and a <b>Shower</b>. These indicate which
        mode through which the user might clean themselves. Selecting an Image will present
        the user with a set of profiles. The number of profiles will vary by mode
        and the number of active users.
    </p>
    <p>
        For instance, if we selected the Bathtub, indicating we wished to have a
        bath, we would see, for this particular household, that there are two Users:
        <b>me</b> which in this instance is household owner and <b>Bob</b>. In either
        case, the result is the same, the layout of the bath interface is determined by
        the users
    </p>
    <img src="html/images/instruct1.png" width="50%" alt="Whose it gonna be, me or Bob?!">

        Though the application distinguishes the major categories
        (<b class="falls">Falls</b> vs <b class="finds">Finds</b>) by color, Orange and yellow respectively, it does not
        make the distinction between the different types of meteoroids. In this case, <strong>Stony</strong>,
        <strong>Iron</strong>, and <strong>Combined-type</strong>. It is up to the user to specifically filter these
        characteristics using the builtin filter option.

        Interaction with the map must be done explicitly with the map directly. That is, the mouse must be hovering over
        some part of the map itself, otherwise nothing can be interacted with. For example, if the user wishes to zoom
        into a specific location, the mouse must be hovering over geographical landmass. If the mouse is hovering what
        could be considered a body of water, interaction is restricted. The same is true when trying to drag the map to
        reorient the view. Unless the user is dragging landmass, interaction is restricted.
