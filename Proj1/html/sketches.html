<h2>The Good</h2>
<section>
    <p>
        The visualization does a nice job of providing the user with a lot of information and data without overwhelming
        them. When any data point clicked, a link to the <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbull.php?code=54823">
        The Meteoritical Society's</a> page with more detailed information about that particular meteorite is shown.
    </p>

    <p>
        When moused over, each data point provides a pop-up with relevant information about that particular
        meteorite including it's name, type, mass, and year found. Some of the more well known meteorites also contain a
        detailed writeup giving the history and significance of the individual meteorite in question.

        The visualization also makes good use of size as a means of representing differences in terms of distinguishing
        a particular meteorite's mass.

        It is easy for the user to filter data by year, Find vs Fall, Type, or Source, allowing for a broad data
        exploration and offers a more detailed look at specific aspects of the data.

    <h4>TLDR</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Clicking on a data point provides a direct link to the Meteoritical Society Page about that particular
            meteor</li>
        <li>Detailed data exploration tool</li>
        <li>Nice filtering capabilities for the data</li>
        <li>Use of size in data markers to disambiguate size differences between meteorites (larger the maker larger
            the space rock)</li>
